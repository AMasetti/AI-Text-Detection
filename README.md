# AI Text Detection

This repository contains code to determine whether a given text was likely written by a human or generated by an AI model, specifically using a modified version of perplexity calculation with Hugging Face's GPT-2 model.

## Usage

### `model.py`

This Python script provides the main functionality for detecting AI-generated text. It defines a class `GPT2PPL` which initializes a GPT-2 language model and tokenizer. The `GPT2PPL` class has methods to calculate perplexity for a given text and classify it as AI-generated or human-written.

#### Dependencies

- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers

#### How to Use

Instantiate the `GPT2PPL` class, and then call it with a text as input. It will return a dictionary containing perplexity metrics, burstiness, and a label indicating whether the text is likely AI-generated or human-written.

### `Detector.ipynb`

This Jupyter Notebook provides an example usage of the `GPT2PPL` class from `model.py`. It loads the model, defines a text sample, and then applies the model to classify the text.

## Example

```python
from model import GPT2PPL

model = GPT2PPL()

text = """
Sample text here...
"""

results, output = model(text)
print(output)
```
